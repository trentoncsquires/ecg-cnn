Title: Using a Convolutional Network to Classify Heart Conditions Based on ECG Waveforms

Description: A convolutional neural network will be trained on the PTB-XL ECG dataset in order to classify patientsâ€™ heart conditions to 5 different classes.  The classes are Normal, Myocardial Infarction, ST/T Change, Conduction Disturbance, and Hypertrophy.  This model will use the Adam optimizer, use the categorical crossentropy loss function, and evaluate the accuracy metric.  The data set I am using, PTB-XL, includes 21799 12-lead ECG waveforms, each of 10 seconds length.
